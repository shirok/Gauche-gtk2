INTRODUCTION
------------

GLGD (GL graph draw) is a set of classes which enables 
Gauche-gtk applications to draw a graph in a Gtk widget.

The application constructs a graph by creating nodes and
defining directional links between them.  Graph can form
general directed graph---cycles and shared-subgraphs are
allowed (though the rendering of such structure isn't
well implemented in the current version).

The current version renders the graph in the 'forest'---
a set of trees.  If it encounters shared substructure or
cycle, it indicates the relation by differently colored links.
In the future version a more flexible layout will be supported,
including 'free layout' where the user can place node freely.

The current API is provisonal.  It is likely to be changed
after a few applications are written.


COMPILATION
-----------

GLGD uses GtkGLArea to display a graph.  In order to display
multilingual text, it also uses Pango with FreeType2 backend.

To compile GLGD with Pango support, configure Gauche-gtk
as follows:

  $ ./configure --enable-glgd-pango

It implies --enable-gtkgl as well.

If you have some problem using pango and can live with
ASCII-only world, you can compile GLGD without pango:

  $ ./configure --enable-glgd


CONCEPTS
--------

Graph classes
.............

GLGD provides four classes to construct a graph.

[class] <glgd-graph>
   A graph itself.  It holds all the structures, and responsible
   to layout and render the graph on the specified window.
   It also provides several callback facilities for applications
   to define user interactions of the graph.

[class] <glgd-node>
   A node of a graph.

[class] <glgd-link>
   A link between nodes.

[class] <glgd-link-list>
   An auxiliary class to represent a set of links.  Links from
   a parent to childrens, for example, can be put in a link-list
   so that it can be rendered as the one link begins from a
   parent and branches to children.

Typical steps to construct a graph are as follow:

 - create a <glgd-graph>.
 - create <glgd-node>s, and adds them to the graph.
 - create <glgd-link-list>s, adds them to the graph.
 - create <glgd-link>s, connects nodes with them,
   and adds them to the graph and link-lists.

You can find a few example scripts under the
Gauche-gtk/examples/glgd directory.  

When a graph is destroyed, nodes, links and link-lists the graph
owned are destroyed, too.  You can also 'flush' the contents of
the graph, i.e. keeping a graph instance but destroying all
nodes, links and link-lists, in order to rebuild a graph.


A higher-level API on top of these primitive graphs is
planned to be created.


Flags and attributes
....................

Each object may have number of flags and attributes.  Each
flag or attribute is a boolean value.  

Flags are used to control a behavior of instances of individual
classes, and mainly used internally; applications are not supposed
to use them.   *-flags-set API can be used to set, reset or toggle
flag(s) of an object.

Attributes can be used by applications to group object(s) in the
graph.  For example, the application can group some nodes and
render them in a specific color.  Attributes can be manipulated
and queried individually, by *-attribute-{clear,set,reset,is-set}
APIs and using attribute index.  Currently, a graph can have up
to 256 attributes; attribute indexes between 0 to 254 are
available (255 is reserved).  This limitation may be removed later.


API REFERENCE
-------------


Common constants
................

[constant] GLGD_FLAGOP_CLEAR
[constant] GLGD_FLAGOP_SET
[constant] GLGD_FLAGOP_TOGGLE

  Specifies flag operations.  Procedures that manipulate bitflags
  take bitmask ('mask') and flag operation ('flag-op') arguments.
  If flag-op is GLGD_FLAGOP_CLEAR, bits given to 'mask' are cleared.
  If flag-op is GLGD_FLAGOP_SET, bits of 'mask' are set.  And if
  flag-op is GLGD_FLAGOP_TOGGLE, bits of 'mask' are inverted.

[constant] GLGD_ATTR_FORCEVISIBLE

  A reserved attribute index.


<glgd-node>
...........

[constant] GLGDNODE_FLAG_HILITE
[constant] GLGDNODE_FLAG_DIM
[constant] GLGDNODE_FLAG_SELECTED

  Pre-defined flags for nodes.

[procedure] glgd-node-create

   Creates a new node.

[procedure] glgd-node-destroy node

   Explicitly destroys a node.  If the node is in the linked chain
   of a graph, subsequent nodes are all destroyed.  Usually you don't
   need to call this, since glgd-graph-fini and glgd-graph-destroy
   call this.

[procedure] glgd-node-label-set node label
[procedure] glgd-node-label-get node

   Sets/gets node label (string), which is displayed on the screen.
   Label must be utf-8 encoded.

[procedure] glgd-node-data-set node data
[procedure] glgd-node-data-get node

   Sets/gets an opaque data to the node.  If you call glgd-node-data-get
   without setting data, #f is returned.

[procedure] glgd-node-id-set node id
[procedure] glgd-node-id-get node

   Sets/gets an node id (integer).  Node id is used to identify
   a node within a graph.  The program needs to ensure every id
   in a graph is unique.

[procedure] glgd-node-info-set node label id

   Convenience function to sets both label and id.

[procedure] glgd-node-flags-set node mask flag-op

   Mainuplates flags of the node.
   
[procedure] glgd-node-is-selected node

   Returns #t if node is selected, #f otherwise.

[procedure] glgd-node-color-default r g b a

   Sets default color of the node which will be created.  Each RGBA value
   must be in the range between 0.0 and 1.0.

[procedure] glgd-node-color-set node r g b a

   Sets the color of the specified node.  Each RGBA value must be in the
   range between 0.0 and 1.0.

[procedure] glgd-node-attribute-clear node
[procedure] glgd-node-attribute-set node attr-index
[procedure] glgd-node-attribute-reset node attr-index
[procedure] glgd-node-attribute-is-set node attr-index

   Manipulates node attributes.


<glgd-link>
...........

[procedure] glgd-link-create

   Creates a new <glgd-link> instance.

[procedure] glgd-link-destroy link

   Explicitly destroys a link.  Usually you don't need to call this,
   since links owned by a graph will be destroyed with the graph.
   
[procedure] glgd-link-set link src-node dst-node

   Sets a link from src-node to dst-node.

[procedure] glgd-link-flags-set link mask flag-op

   Manipulate link flags.


<glgd-link-list>
................

[procedure] glgd-link-list-create

   Creates a new <link-list> instance.

[procedure] glgd-link-list-destroy link-list

   Explicitly destroys a link-list.  Usually you don't need to call
   this, since link-lists owned by a graph will be destroyed with
   the graph.

[procedure] glgd-link-list-flags-set link-list mask flag-op

   Manipulate link-list flags.


<glgd-graph>
............

[constant] GLGDGRAPH_FN_MOUSE_LEFT

[constant] GLGDGRAPH_FN_MOUSE_SCROLL
[constant] GLGDGRAPH_FN_MOUSE_HOVER
[constant] GLGDGRAPH_FN_KEY
[constant] GLGDGRAPH_FN_PRERENDER

   These values are used to specify a callback function type
   in glgd-graph-callback-set.

[constant] GLGDGRAPH_FLAG_CTRLHELD
[constant] GLGDGRAPH_FLAG_ESCPRESSED
[constant] GLGDGRAPH_FLAG_PANGOBOLD

   Predefined flags that are used internally.


[procedure] glgd-graph-create

   Creates and initializes a new <glgd-graph> instance, and returns it.

[procedure] glgd-graph-destroy graph

   Explicitly destroys <glgd-graph> instance and frees related
   resources.

[procedure] glgd-graph-init graph

   Initializes <glgd-graph> instance, so that it can be used to
   add nodes/links and be rendered.  If you want to re-initialize
   graph, you must call glgd-graph-fini first.

[procedure] glgd-graph-fini graph

   Clears <glgd-graph> instance's internal structure, such as
   node and link lists.  All nodes and links associated to the graph
   are destroyed.

[procedure] glgd-graph-draw graph

   Renders graph.  The destination window should have been
   specified by glgd-graph-connect.
   Typically you call this procedure when you need to redisplay the
   graph, such as in the callback of expose_event.

[procedure] glgd-graph-frame graph

   Resets graph's viewport so that all the nodes can be visible.

[procedure] glgd-graph-invalidate graph

   Calls gdk_window_invalidate_rect on the window attached to
   graph, so that the expose_event callback would be emitted
   to trigger redrawing of the graph.

[procedure] glgd-graph-reshape graph

   Notify the graph that the dimension of the drawing area
   is changed.  The actual dimension will be computed when
   the graph is rendered in the next time.

[procedure] glgd-graph-connect graph drawing-area

   Drawing-area should be <gtk-widget>.
   Attaches the graph to the drawing area.  The graph will
   take events from the drawing area, and will be rendered
   into it.

[procedure] glgd-graph-translate graph x y

   Moves graph contents by [x, y], both in real number.

[procedure] glgd-graph-center graph

   Adjusts graph contents so that it is placed in the center
   of the viewport.

[procedure] glgd-graph-callback-set graph type proc

   Sets a callback procedure proc to the graph.
   The type argument takes one of the value of GLGDGRAPH_FN_*
   constants.   The procedure is called with four arguments,
   a <glgd-graph> object, a <node> object on which the mouse
   cursor is on, a <link> object on which the mouse cursor
   is on, and a <gdk-event> object.

The Scheme scripts in this directory are ported from examples
that come with Gtk2.  (The original source can be found under the
examples directory of Gtk source code).  The scripts are named
according to the original source, i.e. arrow.scm for arrow.c, etc.

Since the original example code comes with Gtk which is LGPL,
I assume the ported Scheme code should be also covered by LGPL.
A copy of LGPL is included in the directory.

I tried to keep the structure of the source, so you can easily
compare the C version and the Scheme version to see how APIs
are mapped.  The most significant difference is callback functions-
in Scheme we can use closures, eliminating the need of 'data'
argument, and 'g_signal_connect_swapped' mechanism.

To run the example script from this directory before installing
Gauche-gtk, run it as follows:

  gosh -I../../src -I../../lib script.scm


The following examples are not ported yet, mainly because of
lack of needed API.

  calendar
  gtkdial
  rulers
  selection
  tictactoe

The following examples are not included, since they use
deprecated widgets.

  text
  tree
